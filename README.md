# Plant-Disease-Prediction
Plant Disease detection involves the steps like image acquisition, image pre-processing, image segmentation, feature extraction and classification.
This paper discussed the methods used for the detection of plant diseases using their leaves images(Using CNN).
Objective:
         To enhance the given input image by Image acquisition and Image pre-processing.
         Identify the affected part through texture analysis and Segmentation.
         Classify the healthy and affected leaf part by feature extraction and classification. 
         Then train the model by using testing data and Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Network) for accurate result.
